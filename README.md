[**Watch a video of the program in action here!**](https://youtu.be/Q3I0QNe0F00)

This program allows you to put yourself in your own GTA:O online lobby by suspending the game process for 10 seconds. This is particularly useful if some *skid hacker* is setting *everyone on fire with their mods* or if you just want some peace and quiet. Your friends will be able to join the session, but other people may join at random due to the match-making algorithm - this program is not designed to fix this problem, although some can.

You can also close the game and all of its processes immediately, in case you take a **massive L** and don't want to save your progress, for example - if you are trying to complete a heist without dying or something.

The key annd controller shortcuts work in game (tested in windowed and fullscreen mode with Windows 10).

This isn't a cheat / hack / menu etc. as it never injects itself in to the game nor does it modify the game in any way. It simply tells the computer to suspend the threads and then resume them. This program **does not** affect any other players as it only drops you from the session. 

## Things you need

* **[.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net40)** (preferably the latest version of the framework)
* A copy of the game might help also.

## Troubleshooting

* *My game freezes!*  
That's the point. Just wait.  
However if it's frozen for more than 10 seconds try going to Resource Monitor and resuming the task. This shouldn't happen, so if it does please open an issue.

* *The software says it can't find the GTA process even though it's open!*  
Try launching the program in administrator mode. I don't know. It's never happened to me before. Open an issue if this happens.

* *The program won't open!*  
Make sure you have downloaded the latest version of the .NET Framework [which you can download from here.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net40)

* *My anti-virus suite says this program is a virus / malware / trojan etc!*  
Any builds from this Github releases are confirmed virus-free. You can see this with the VirusTotal scans I add to every release. Your anti-virus suite is probably flagging it as it doesn't have a code signature. No need to worry. Just whitelist it and move on. If you are still worried, the code is right here - see for yourself.

* *My controller isn't detected by the program!*  
Check the status in the Settings menu. If the status shows your controller is not connected, try restarting the program. Also, try unticking the controller support box, saving the settings, then rechecking it and saving again. This makes the program recheck for your controller.
Make sure your controller is XInput compatible, and make sure it works in-game before opening an issue. Xbox 360 / Xbox One variant controllers should work fine, and Dualshock 4 should work fine using DS4Windows - I wrote and debugged the controller code using this setup.

If your problem isn't on this list, or if the solution listed doesn't work, please open a GitHub issue.

## Lovely people who helped make this possible

Thank you to the following people!

* [@JordanOcokoljic](https://github.com/JordanOcokoljic) - first tester, assisted with cleaning up my 5 minute hack job!
* [@charlco](https://github.com/charlco) - discovered exceptions that needed to be handled!
* [@Assasindie](https://github.com/Assasindie) - contributed improvements to exception handling!
* Pongo and Llamasassboat - suggested the key shortcut to instantly quit the game!
* Magnus Johansson Otiel and henon on StackOverflow - contributed a great amount of the codebase!

## Features that I might implement or might not

See [this kanban board](https://github.com/BradF-99/GTAPanicButton/projects/1) for stuff I'm working on.  

Here are some other things I might work on:  
* *A nicer interface* - I don't know how to improve on perfection but I can certainly try!
* *Changeable key shortcuts* - pick your own button combos!
* *Apple HomeKit / Amazon Alexa / Google Home Integration* (not really)
